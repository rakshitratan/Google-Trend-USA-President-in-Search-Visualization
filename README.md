Sometime back I was reading an article about the USPresident Joe Biden approval ratings at 100 days into office and him being one ofthe most searched names on Google around the globe. So, as a voter of our respective country, we know most people’s perception towards their leader isbased on the data available out there i.e., the Internet.

To have some insight into this theory I have visualised the Googlesearch trend of the recent and former presidents of the USA at 100 days into the first term along with the approval ratings they have and had. Along with theinauguration speech given by them. 

DATA: Google Trends is thedatabase of the terms and content searched by people around the worlddetailed to geographic location. I gathered the USA President 'Year in Searchdata 100 days into the first term. Then the Inaugural Speech, as well as the approval rating data, was scraped from the White House press website usingpython.


For the analysis, the last three president’sdata was collected for the year 2021 for Joe Biden, 2017 for Donald Trump and2009 for Barack Obama. Since % of U.S. adultswho say they use the internet was 93%, 88% and 76% in the Inauguration years, respectively.The analysis insights could be of value, but for me, it was an analytical way tosolve my curiosity.

Insights: 
> Clearly Donald Trump is themost searched president causing him a higher loss of confidence of the public.
> From the Word Cloud, it can be clearly seenthat Trump mostly stresses American interests in limited scope whereas Bidenand Obama have stressed the overall American interest at home and abroad.
