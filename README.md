# Google Trend USA President in Search Visualization
Google Trends is the database of the terms and content searched by the people around the world detailed to geographic location. I gathered the USA President 'Year in Search' data at 100 days into first term. Apart from that I gathered the Inaugural Speech as well as the approval rating data. The data gathered indicate that the ‘Search interest over time’ has some effect over the approval rating of the president and the ‘word cloud’ represents the most frequent words used during the inaugural speech.  NOTE: Interest Over Time is the Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term.
