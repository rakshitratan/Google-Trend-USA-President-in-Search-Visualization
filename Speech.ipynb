Millions of jobs have been lost; hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear.

      "<p>Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, and my distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans: This is America's day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge.</p>\n",
      "<p>Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. The people—the will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.</p>\n",
      "<p>So now, on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one Nation under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way—restless, bold, optimistic—and set our sights on the Nation we know we can be and we must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the strength of our Nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last night, who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.</p>\n",
      "<p>I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots have taken, the oath first sworn by George Washington. But the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on \"We the People,\" who seek a more perfect Union.</p>\n",
      "<p>This is a great Nation; we are good people. Over the centuries, through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we've come so far. But we still have far to go. We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities: much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain.</p>\n",
      "<p>Few people in our Nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now. A once-in-a-century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost; hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise of political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.</p>\n",
      "<p>To overcome these challenges—to restore the soul and secure the future of America—requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity. Unity.</p>\n",
      "<p>In another January on New Year's Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said, and I quote, \"If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act, and my whole soul is in it.\" My whole soul is in it.</p>\n",
      "<p>Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our Nation. And I ask every American to join me in this cause: uniting to fight the foes we face: anger, resentment, and hatred; extremism, lawlessness, violence; disease, joblessness, and hopelessness.</p>\n",
      "<p>With unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all. We can deliver racial justice, and we can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.</p>\n",
      "<p>I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. And victory is never assured.</p>\n",
      "<p>Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our \"better angels\" have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us—enough of us—have come together to carry all of us forward. And we can do that now. History, faith, and reason show the way: the way of unity.</p>\n",
      "<p>We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos.</p>\n",
      "<p>This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. And we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.</p>\n",
      "<p>And so today, at this time, in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another, hear one another, see one another, show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.</p>\n",
      "<p>My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be better than this. And I believe America is so much better than this.</p>\n",
      "<p>Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as was mentioned earlier, completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself was literally hanging in the balance. Yet we endured, we prevailed.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here we stand looking out on the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at another Inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And today we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history elected to national office: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.</p>\n",
      "<p>And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever—not ever.</p>\n",
      "<p>To all those who supported our campaign, I am humbled by the faith you've placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps this Nation's greatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to disunion. And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans—all Americans. And I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.</p>\n",
      "<p>Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love—defined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects we as Americans love? That define us as Americans? I think we know: opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and yes, the truth.</p>\n",
      "<p>Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth, and there are lies: lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders—leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our Nation—to defend the truth and defeat the lies.</p>\n",
      "<p>Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with fear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I understand, like my dad, they lay at bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering: \"Can I keep my health care? Can I pay my mortgage?\" Thinking about their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don't look like you or worship the way you do or don't get their news from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment. Stand in their shoes.</p>\n",
      "<p>Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That is what we do for one another. And if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree.</p>\n",
      "<p>My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we're going to need each other. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one Nation. One Nation. And I promise you this: As the Bible says, \"Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" We will get through this, together—together.</p>\n",
      "<p>Look, folks, all my colleagues that I served with in the House and the Senate up here. We all understand the world is watching, watching all of us today. So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested, and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again, not to meet yesterday's challenges, but today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. We will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.</p>\n",
      "<p>Look, you all know, we have been through so much in this Nation. And, in my first act as President, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic, those 400,000 fellow Americans: moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daughters, friends, neighbors, and coworkers. We will honor them by becoming the people and Nation we know we can and should be.</p>\n",
      "<p>So I ask you, let's say a silent prayer for those who have lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country.</p>\n",
      "<p>[<i>At this point, a moment of silence was observed.</i>]</p>\n",
      "<p>Amen.</p>\n",
      "<p>Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on truth, a raging virus, growing inequity, the sting of systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is, we face them all at once, presenting this Nation with one of the gravest of responsibilities we've had.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up? All of us? It is time for boldness, for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you: We will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era. Will we rise to the occasion, is the question. Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children? I believe we must; I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will.</p>\n",
      "<p>And when we do, we will write the next great chapter in the history of the United States of America: the American story, a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. It's called \"American Anthem,\" and there's one verse that stands out, at least for me, and it goes like this:</p>\n",
      "<p>\"The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day<br/>What shall be our legacy? What will our children say? . . .<br/>Let me know in my heart when my days are through<br/>America, America, I gave my best to you.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's add—let's us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great Nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us: \"They gave their best. They did their duty. They healed a broken land.\"</p>\n",
      "<p>My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you I give you my word: I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I will defend our democracy. I will defend America. And I will give all, all of you, keep everything you—I do, in your service, thinking not of power, but of possibilities; not of personal interest, but of the public good. And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear; of unity, not division; of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness.</p>\n",
      "<p>May this be the story that guides us, the story that inspires us, and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history, we met the moment; democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch, but thrived; that America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow.</p>\n",
      "<p>So with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time, sustained by faith, driven by conviction, and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts.</p>\n",
      "<p>May God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, America.</p>\n",

The people—the people heard, people heeded. We\\'ve learned democracy precious, democracy fragile. And hour, friends, democracy prevailed. So now, hallowed ground days ago violence sought shake Capitol\\'s foundation, come Nation God, indivisible, carry peaceful transfer power centuries. As look ahead uniquely American way—restless, bold, optimistic—and set sights Nation know be, I thank predecessors parties presence today. I thank heart. And I know resilience Constitution strength, strength Nation, President Carter, I spoke night, today, salute lifetime service. I taken sacred oath patriots taken, oath sworn George Washington. But American story depends us, us, us, \"We People,\" seek perfect Union. This great Nation; good people. Over centuries, storm strife, peace war, we\\'ve come far. But far go. We\\'ll press forward speed urgency, winter peril significant possibilities: repair, restore, heal, build, gain. Few people Nation\\'s history challenged time challenging difficult time we\\'re now. A once-in-a-century virus silently stalks country taken lives year America lost World War II. Millions jobs lost; hundreds thousands businesses closed. A racial justice 400 years making moves us. The dream justice deferred longer. A survival comes planet itself, can\\'t desperate clear. And now, rise political extremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism confront defeat. To overcome challenges—to restore soul secure future America—requires words. It requires elusive things democracy: unity. Unity. In January New Year\\'s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed Emancipation Proclamation. When pen paper, President said, I quote, \"If goes history act, soul it.\" My soul it. Today, January day, soul this: bringing America together, uniting people, uniting Nation. And I ask American join cause: uniting fight foes face: anger, resentment, hatred; extremism, lawlessness, violence; disease, joblessness, hopelessness. With unity great things, important things. We right wrongs. We people work good jobs. We teach children safe schools. We overcome deadly virus. We reward work rebuild middle class health care secure all. We deliver racial justice, America, again, leading force good world. I know speaking unity sound like foolish fantasy days. I know forces divide deep real. But I know new. Our history constant struggle American ideal created equal harsh, ugly reality racism, nativism, fear, demonization long torn apart. The battle perennial. And victory assured. Through Civil War, Great Depression, World War, 9/11, struggle, sacrifice, setbacks, \"better angels\" prevailed. In moments, us—enough us—have come carry forward. And now. History, faith, reason way: way unity. We adversaries, neighbors. We treat dignity respect. We join forces, stop shouting, lower temperature. For unity, peace, bitterness fury. No progress, exhausting outrage. No nation, state chaos. This historic moment crisis challenge, unity path forward. And meet moment United States America. If that, I guarantee you, fail. We never, ever, ever, failed America acted together. And today, time, place, let\\'s start afresh, us. Let\\'s begin listen another, hear another, another, respect another. Politics doesn\\'t raging destroying path. Every disagreement doesn\\'t cause total war. And reject culture facts manipulated manufactured. My fellow Americans, different this. America better this. And I believe America better this. Just look around. Here stand, shadow Capitol dome, mentioned earlier, completed amid Civil War, Union literally hanging balance. Yet endured, prevailed. Here stand looking great Mall Dr. King spoke dream. Here stand, 108 years ago, Inaugural, thousands protesters tried block brave women marching right vote. And today mark swearing-in woman American history elected national office: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don\\'t tell things can\\'t change. Here stand Potomac Arlington Cemetery, heroes gave measure devotion rest eternal peace. And stand, days riotous mob thought use violence silence people, stop work democracy, drive sacred ground. It happen. It happen, today, tomorrow, ever—not ever. To supported campaign, I humbled faith you\\'ve placed us. To support us, let this: Hear forward. Take measure heart. And disagree, it. That\\'s democracy. That\\'s America. The right dissent peaceably, guardrails Republic, Nation\\'s greatest strength. Yet hear clearly: Disagreement lead disunion. And I pledge you: I President Americans—all Americans. And I promise you, I fight hard support did. Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, saint church, wrote people multitude defined common objects love—defined common objects love. What common objects Americans love? That define Americans?

And duty responsibility, citizens, Americans, especially leaders—leaders pledged honor Constitution protect Nation—to defend truth defeat lies. Look, I understand fellow Americans view future fear trepidation. I understand worry jobs. I understand, like dad, lay bed night staring ceiling, wondering: \"Can I health care?

We end uncivil war pits red blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We open souls instead hardening hearts, little tolerance humility, we\\'re willing stand person\\'s shoes, mom say, moment. Stand shoes. Because thing life: There accounting fate deal you. Some days need hand. There days we\\'re called lend hand. That\\'s be. That another. And way, country stronger, prosperous, ready future. And disagree.

We set aside politics finally face pandemic Nation. One Nation. And I promise this: As Bible says, \"Weeping endure night, joy cometh morning.\" We this, together—together. Look, folks, colleagues I served House Senate here. We understand world watching, watching today. So message borders: America tested, come stronger it. We repair alliances engage world again, meet yesterday\\'s challenges, today\\'s tomorrow\\'s challenges. And we\\'ll lead merely example power, power example. We strong trusted partner peace, progress, security. Look, know, Nation.

I believe must; I\\'m sure well. I believe will. And do, write great chapter history United States America: American story, story sound like song means lot me. It\\'s called \"American Anthem,\" there\\'s verse stands out, me, goes like this: \"The work prayers centuries brought dayWhat shall legacy?
